    "description":  "17TH JUL 2021As of 17 July 2021, 12pm, Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified that there are 60 cases of locally transmitted COVitemid-19 infection, of which 29 belong to the KTV cluster. Of the 60 cases today, 33 are linked to previous cases, and have already been placed on quarantine. 25 are linked to previous cases and were detected through surveillance. 2 are currently unlinked.1 There are 8 imported cases, who have already been placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. 1 was detected upon arrival in Singapore, while 7 developed the illness during SHN or isolation. In total, there are 68 new cases of COVitemid-19 infection in Singapore today. There are currently 5 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 1 in critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU).2. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased from 17 cases in the week before to 239 cases in the past week. We are likely to see rising cases in the coming days as we step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the community. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from 8 cases in the week before to 22 cases in the past week. The 7-day moving average number of all linked community cases and all unlinked community cases are 31.0 and 3.1 respectively.3. There are a total of 8 imported cases today. 1 was detected upon arrival in Singapore, while 7 developed the illness during SHN or isolation.Active clusters under monitoring4. There are 3 new clusters today. In total, there are currently 29 active clusters, ranging between 3 and 148 infections. MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the Case 64263 cluster for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed. ",
