    "description":  "Paternity Leave Policy\n\nThe University is committed to supporting employees to understand the choices available to them when planning for the birth or adoption of a child. Families now have additional options open to them with regards to managing time off during the first year after their child’s birth or adoption and this policy should be read in conjunction with the University’s policies on Maternity Leave or Adoption Leave as well as Shared Parental Leave to ensure that employees are fully aware of all of the options available to them and their family. The University Nursery also provides childcare at subsidised rates depending on eligibility and availability.\n\n1.2 The University provides an Enhanced Paternity Leave Scheme, which exceeds the statutory provision by providing for two weeks on full pay. \n　\n1.3 This policy sets out the entitlement and associated processes that apply to paternity leave and pay. Whilst known as ‘Paternity Leave’, this policy equally applies to same sex partners. \n　\n1.4 The following definitions are used within this policy\u0026#58;\n　\nExpected Week of Childbirth (EWOC) The week, beginning with midnight between Saturday and Sunday, in which it is expected that childbirth will occur. Qualifying Week The 15th week before the EWOC. Matching Week The week commencing the Sunday on or immediately prior to the date on which the adopter was told that they have been told by the adoption agency that they have been matched with a child for adoption. .\n　",
