It is organised by Centre for Fathering.\r\nEat With Your Family Day takes place　four times a year　on the last day of the school term, at the start of the　school holidays.\r\nCompanies like City Development Limited and Etiqa Insurance Pte Ltd have also adopted Eat with Your Family Day as a way to promote a family-friendly work culture.\r\n\u0026quot;As a family-friendly company, CDL recognises that employees can be more productive and effective at work when they are able to harmonise family and work responsibilities. Over the years, we implemented a series of other initiatives and schemes to foster a family-friendly work culture. EWYFD has become an integral part of our family-friendly initiatives. Since 2012, we have also increased the frequency of this initiative to four times a year to encourage employees to leave work earlier to have dinner with their family,\u0026quot; said Mr Steven Tan, Chief Human Resource Officer, City Developments Ltd.\r\nThis year, the organisers of Eat With Your Family Day are working with more than 40 organisations to plan a special programme for their employees. 150 families who have been nominated will be receiving a family meal delivered to their homes on Friday, 4 September 2020.\r\n　\r\nPromotions \u0026amp; Specials\r\nIn addition, there are special deals from merchants islandwide to provide families with more food, retail and fun options.\r\nThere will also be special movie screening of \u0026quot;Happy Feet\u0026quot; on 4 September 2020 at 6.20 pm on Mediacorp Channel 5.\r\n",
