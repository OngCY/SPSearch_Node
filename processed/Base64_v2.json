Our layout is also different, consisting of mainly small rooms whose occupants never inter-mingle. This layout is highly compatible with safe distancing.\"\r\n\r\nPublic entertainment licences for establishments are handled by the police.\r\n\r\nThe petition had garnered more than 1,600 signatures by 1pm on Friday.\r\n\r\nHoping to resume business sooner, the nine outlets have also called for the creation of a pilot scheme that would allow them to operate under strict safety measures. This could include opening karaoke rooms only to those who have been fully vaccinated, or those who undergo pre-event testing, the petition proposed.\r\n\r\nThis comes after a pilot programme by the Government to reopen nightlife establishments was put on hold in January after a spike in community cases.\r\n\r\nRestrictions have already taken a toll on family karaoke outlets, whose numbers have been whittled down from more than 50 before Covid-19 hit in March last year, to fewer than 20 left standing.\r\n\r\nIn May, major karaoke chain Manekineko closed all eight of its outlets here.\r\n\r\nOthers like Cash Studio and Teo Heng pivoted their businesses to reopen as work and study rooms or food and beverage outlets to stay afloat."},{"itemid":"f2ba60d1-7156-25fb-b198-a39cf48eef63","url":"https://es.tap.dev.sg/policy/annualLeave?id=f2ba60d1-7156-25fb-b198-a39cf48eef63","published_date":"26/6/2021 0:00","expiry_date":"26/6/2099 0:00","title":"Annual leave eligibility and entitlement","content":"Eligibility\nYou are entitled to paid annual leave if you have worked for your employer for at least 3 months.\n\nYou can only apply for annual leave after working for 3 months.\n\nEntitlement\nYour annual leave entitlement depends on how many years of service you have with your employer.

It noted that it would be very challenging to check the status of individuals before they seat themselves at a table.\r\n\r\nEntertainment such as live performances, recorded music and video or television screenings will continue to be prohibited at food and beverage establishments.\r\n\r\nMOH said that this is because dining-in remains a high-risk activity because many people will be unmasked and in close proximity with each other.\r\n\r\n\"Patrons at food and beverage establishments are also reminded to adhere to all safe management measures and keep their masks on at all times except when eating or drinking,\" said MOH."}]
