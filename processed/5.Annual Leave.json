INTRODUCTION\nThe University of Glasgow promotes a positive and healthy work-life balance and recognises the importance of annual leave in achieving this. This policy, which applies to all members of staff, aims to provide a fair, consistent and equitable approach to the accrual and taking of annual leave, ensuring that individual needs are balanced with operational requirements.\n2. PRINCIPLES\n2.1 It is important that members of staff take regular breaks from their duties through annual leave.\n2.2 The holiday leave year operates from 1 January to 31 December.\n2.3 Members of staff are expected to take their annual leave entitlement within the leave year period.\n2.4 Entitlements to leave are pro-rated for part-time/term-time staff, and those who join or leave part-way through a leave year.\n2.5 Leave is granted subject to operational requirements.\n2.6 All members of staff will be expected to take any outstanding holidays before leaving the University. Normally no additional payment will be made for leave not taken. Similarly, where leave has been taken in excess of the entitlement, a pro-rated adjustment will be made and deducted from the final salary payment.\n2.7 This policy will be applied in a fair and consistent manner and without discrimination, in line with the University’s　\n\n\n","published_date":"2021-07-19T00:37:28Z","expiry_date":"2022-02-26T08:00:00Z","attachment_url":"http://collaborate20.dev.gov.sg/sand/test/policy/_api/Web/Lists(guid'df0937a0-ac1d-42bb-9b98-693bad987a5e')/Items(5)/AttachmentFiles('annualLeavePolicyAnnexA.txt')","attachment_base64":"ï»¿6. CARRYING ANNUAL LEAVE FORWARD\r\nWhile members of staff are expected to take their holidays in the leave year in which they have accrued, staff may, with the agreement of their Head of School/RI/University Service, carry forward a maximum of 5 days holiday into the next leave year (pro-rated for part-time staff). \r\n\r\nWhere, as a result of extenuating circumstances, a member of staff has been unable to take their full leave entitlement, requests to carry forward leave will not be unreasonably refused. Any days carried forward must be taken by 31 March that year or the holidays will lapse. Where there are maternity related or long-term sick leave implications please refer to Section 7.\r\n\r\nPlease note, there is a temporary change in place regarding carrying over of leave due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Please see the Coronavirus Staff Information Portal for further details.\r\n\r\n7. ABSENCE & HOLIDAYS\r\n7.1 Illness during holiday: Members of staff who fall sick either during a period of annual leave or just prior to the leave commencing, will be permitted to reclaim those days lost through illness (or, in the latter case, may reschedule their annual leave for another time once they have recovered) where the absence is certified by a medical fit note. This period of absence will then be recorded as sickness absence. Please note that the requirement to provide a medical fit note applies even where the absence is less than 7 days in duration. This arrangement also applies to public holidays/âother daysâ.\r\n\r\n7.2 Accrual of holidays during periods of sickness absence: Typically, holiday entitlement will continue to accrue as normal during periods of sickness absence. In cases of long term sickness absence, where this would result in holidays being carried into the next leave year, members of staff should seek advice from their College/University Services HR team regarding entitlement.\r\n\r\n7.3 Accrual of holidays during maternity, adoption and paternity leave: Members of staff will continue to accrue contractual holiday entitlement (including entitlement to public holidays and âother daysâ) as normal during the full period of maternity, adoption and paternity leave. For further details please see our other Leave Policies.\r\n\r\n8.
