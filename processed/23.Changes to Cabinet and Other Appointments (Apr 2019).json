Notification Process\r\n4.1 It is recognised that the timing of Paternity Leave cannot be fully predicted. Employees\r\nshould therefore give as much notice as possible to their manager of the likely or actual\r\ndates to be taken.\r\n4.2 Employees should notify their line manager through Employee Self Service of their\r\nintention to take Paternity Leave in or before the 15th week before the expected week of\r\nchildbirth (or, in the case of the adoption of a child, within 7 days of having been notified\r\nby the adoption agency of the match with a child). When requesting the leave, the\r\nemployee will be required to specify:\r\nâ¢ The expected week of childbirth, or the date the child is expected to be placed for\r\nadoption together with the date that the adopter was notified of having been\r\nmatched with a child;\r\nâ¢ The date on which the employee has chosen the leave to commence (the option\r\nof commencing the leave on the âactual date of birthâ will be given);\r\nâ¢ The length of paternity leave they wish to take i.e. a one or two week period.\r\n4.3 When requesting the leave, the employee will also be asked to declare that the absence\r\nfrom work is to care for the relevant child and/or to support the child's mother/main\r\nadopter. \r\n\r\n5. Commencement of Paternity Leave\r\n5.1 Eligible employees may commence their paternity leave any time from the date of the\r\nbirth/placement of their child (subject to compliance with the notification procedures),\r\nhowever the leave must be completed within 8 weeks following the birth/placement.\r\n6. Shared Parental Leave (SPL)\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
