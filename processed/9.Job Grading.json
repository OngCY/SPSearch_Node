You must indicate if you would like the arrangement to be for a limited\r\nperiod only, otherwise it will be assumed that you are requesting a permanent\r\nchange. You must send in your request at least three months before you wish the\r\nchange in working arrangement to take effect.\r\nYou must state on the form if you are making your request in relation to the Equality Act 2010. If\r\nyou have a disability your request may be considered as a reasonable adjustment.\r\nIf you already have a flexible working arrangement and are applying for a new role you must ask\r\nthe recruiting manager if it is possible to retain the arrangement if you are appointed. The\r\nrecruiting manager will consider your request in line with the procedure below.\r\n2. Considering your request\r\nIf your manager is satisfied that your request can be met they may agree to it without having to\r\nhold a meeting with you.\r\nIf your manager wishes to find out more about your request and how it will affect the needs of\r\nyour business area you will be invited to attend a meeting. A meeting will normally take place\r\nwithin two calendar weeks of submitting your request. You may be accompanied by a trade union\r\nrepresentative or work colleague if you wish.
